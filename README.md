OLED_SSD1306
============

Hyper Fast driver for SSD1306, only SPI, for Arduino and Teensy3

It may work with other CPU but I have not tested. The Paul Stoffregen's Font Technology it's working but not enabled for solid background (I will enable this soon).
This new version it's fully SPI Transaction compatible, faster than previous version, doesn't need the Adafruit_GFX and play nice with other SPI devices.
